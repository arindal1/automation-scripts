# WhatsApp Mass Mention Script

This Python scripts helps user to mentioan all/said number of user in a WhatsApp group.

1. **User Input for Group Size:**
   Allow the user to input the size of the group. This provides flexibility and allows you to specify the number of times the "down" arrow key should be pressed.

2. **Include a Delay:**
   Introduce a small delay between each iteration of the loop. This can prevent the script from executing too quickly and overwhelming the application.

3. **Graceful Exit:**
   Add a condition to exit the loop after a certain number of iterations or based on user input. This prevents the script from running indefinitely.

4. **Code Refactoring:**
   Consider refactoring the code to make it more modular. You can define functions for specific actions, making the code easier to read and maintain.



This code includes a function `mention_all` for the main task, a separate function `press_down_key` for pressing the "down" key, and a delay between iterations to ensure the script works smoothly. The user is prompted to input the size of the group before the script starts. Additionally, there's a try-except block to handle cases where the user enters an invalid input.
