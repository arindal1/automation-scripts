## How to use?
(most scripts need their dependencies, so install them before running the scripts)

- **Python** codes can be run through the terminal using `python filename.py` or if it uses **Streamlit** use `streamlit run filename.py`, and run **Flask** files using `python app.py` and the access the localhost using `app.run(debug=True, port=8000)`.
- **Shell** scripts can be run through the terminal. You have to make the file executable using `chmod +x your_script_name.sh` then run it using `./your_script_name.sh`.
- **CPP** scripts can be run through the terminal by compiling it using `g++ your_file.cpp -o output_executable` then running the compiled file using `./output_executable`.
